Software:

In today's world, computers are present nearly everywhere. In almost all work
places, computers provide the driving force behind efficiency. Therefore,
faculty with computers is one of the most important skills in the business
world. Typing, being the main interface one has with a computer, is required
above all. Those who do not know how to type are at a severe
disadvantage. In order to prevent this, it is best to start learning how to
type as a child. The problem is, for most people, typing is not inherently
fun. Therefore, in order to effectively teach typing to a child, one must
develop software that is both fun to use and effective in teaching typing. 
Our solution to this is to create a game that the child can play via typing
words that appear on the screen. This program will also be useful for adults
who wish to improve their typing skills, including the use of numbers,
commands, and symbols. 

Solution:

The user navigates an avatar throughout a two-dimensional world, avoiding obstances, traversing
heights, and slaying enemies by means of typing. The avatar, a sprite, appears to be
running to the right across a moving screen. In order to overcome an obstacle,
the user must correctly type the specified word that appears on or near the
respective obstacle. Various game levels are determined by the speed of the
moving board, the length of the words to be typed, and the presence of special
characters and keys (such as "thIs" and "$@$$y"). SDL graphics will be used to
design the background screen, while sprites will be used to animate the moving
figures.
